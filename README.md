# audio-steganography-algorithms
A collection of audio steganography - watermarking algorithms written in Matlab

I have been working on implenting several existing techiques, such as:

1) Spread Spectrum
  - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum in Time Domain
  - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum in DWT Domain
  - Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum in Cepstrum
2) Echo Hiding
  - Echo Hiding with Single Kernel
  - Echo Hiding with Dual Kernel
  - Echo Hiding with Backward and Forward Kernels
  - Time Spread Echo Hiding
  - Analysis-by-Synthesis Approach  
3) Phase Coding
4) Least Significant Bit (LSB) Coding
  - LSB Coding in Time Domain
  - LSB Coding in DWT Coefficents
5) Parity Coding
6) Quantization Index Modulation

I have completed writing most of these algorithms in Matlab, few more to go and I will start uploading. It was very hard for me to reach a level of understanding Digital Signal Processing terms enough. And there were not enough sources where it was explained with simple words, so I will try to make it easier for others who are also interested in this topic.

I plan to start coding all algorithms in other languages as well such as Phyton and Java, maybe there will be others who will want to help me creating this library in other languages as well.
